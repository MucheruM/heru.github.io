	<h1> The Maze Project </h1>
	<p>This is my final project as an ALX SWE student having undergone a regoruous 1 year boot camp. The project is an adoption of the maze game with some added attributes that make it appear like a first shooter application. The game is made using the C language and a combination of SDL2 and Raycasting for 3D and texture rendering. Special effects added include mussle flash, rain and guns.:x!
