		<h1> The Maze Project </h1>
		<p>This is my final project as an ALX SWE student having undergone a regoruous 1 year boot camp. The project is an adoption of the maze game with some added attributes that make it appear like a first shooter application. The game is made using the C language and a combination of SDL2 and Raycasting for 3D and texture rendering. Special effects added include mussle flash, rain and guns.:x!

		<h2>About the Maze Project</h2>
		<p>The Maze game is an optional and final portfolio project presentation inspired by ALX Africa. The motivation for creating the Maze Game stemmed from the team's shared interests and their decision-making process in a scrum and agile setting. One team member, inspired by a lifelong passion for 3D maze games and problem-solving, envisioned a game that could evoke the same excitement and challenge. This vision resonated with the rest of the team, leading to a collaborative effort to create an immersive and strategically challenging gaming experience. The project is driven by their collective childhood experiences and a desire to engage players in complex environments.

		<h2>Meet the Team</h2>
		<p>Satson Johnson- Satson with his skills in Raycasting Technology, handled most of our raycasting functions which helps players to navigate the game and preventing collisions or walking into the walls.
Mucheru Heru- Mucheru in C programming language handled our maps (the course for the game to run) and renders for rain options and other functions in the future. 
Mercy Oyetunde- Mercy in C programming language sourced for our texture files and implemented the texture which is the physical display for the game, what the players see.
		</p>
		<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
		<p>C Programming Language: We chose C for its performance benefits and low-level control, which are crucial for game development.
SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer): SDL was used for its ability to handle graphics, sound, and input, providing a comprehensive multimedia development library. It allowed us to focus on game logic without worrying about the underlying platform-specific details.
GDB (GNU Debugger): GDB was essential for debugging, allowing us to identify and fix segmentation faults and other issues efficiently.
